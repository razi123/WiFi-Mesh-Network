# WiFi-Mesh-Network

    The project WiFi mesh network is aimed to build a platform for wireless communication between multiple ESP32 devices. ESP32 is dual core high performance, low cost. Integrated WiFi dual mode Bluetooth microcontroller device. Each Esp32 device can interface with sensors(Like temperature, humidity, pressure etc.) and the sensors data are shared among them via different network topologies (Star, mesh etc.)
    
# Objective

    Create a WiFi Network with ESP-WROOM-32 and Share data with different network topologies (Mesh and Star) using cloud service via MQTT protocol.
    
# ESP32 Features

     1. 2.2V to 3.6V operating voltage
     2. 32 GPIO pins:
     3. 3x UARTs, including hardware flow control
     4. 3x SPI, 2x I2S and 12x ADC input channels 
     5  2x DAC and 2x I2C
     6. PWM/timer input/output available on every GPIO pin 
     7. Supports external SPI flash up to 16 MB 
     8. SD-card interface support
 
 # MQTT Protocol
 
     MQTT stands for Message Queue Telemetry Transfer protocol which is developed by IBM. Itâ€™s a light weight message publish/subscribe protocol that is built on top of TCP/IP which send/receive data over a broker.
